            , we believe that investing should not only generate financial
            returns but also contribute to a sustainable future. Our platform
            encourages individuals to invest at least 1% of their income in
            green mutual funds and ESG
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-400 mb-6">
            Green investing allows you to grow your wealth while promoting
            clean energy, ethical labor practices, and responsible governance.
            Unlike traditional investments, ESG funds focus on companies that
            are making a positive environmental and social impact.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-green-400 font-semibold">
            We aim to create a movement where every small contribution leads
            to a big impact. By investing in ESG funds, you are not just
            securing your financial future but also contributing to a
            healthier planet. Join GreenVest today and be a part of the
            change! üåç
