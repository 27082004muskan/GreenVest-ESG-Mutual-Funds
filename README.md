## Why We Built This

Traditional investment platforms either ignore ESG completely or make it so complex that nobody uses it. We wanted something different - a platform where sustainable investing feels natural and accessible.

The financial industry needs more transparency about where money actually goes. This is our attempt to provide that clarity.
